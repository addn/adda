. adda is the programming language of addx,  a secure and friendly system that promotes computing as a universal 2nd language

. having everyone -- including children and seniors -- as its intended client requires that addx provide a programming language that is not straying far from current conventions while at the same time improving on natural language with an elegant system that has fewer rules for the beginner to learn .

. a language should also be iconic like math, never using a keyword when a symbol would be more easily understood; though neither should it be using a morass of arcane symbols just for the sake of abbreviation .

. there should be a binary version of the language, -- a common intermediate language -- and tools that allow humans to work in the language of their choice .
-- because freedom, foremost, is the Americium Dream .

. there is no code at this time; just a blog .
